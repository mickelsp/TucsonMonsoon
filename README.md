TucsonMonsoon
=============

Histogram showing the start of the monsoon season in Tucson. Data is for 1949-2012. The 2013 monsoon has officially started because NOAA now defines the monsoon season as June 15th to September 30th.  However, before 2008, the criterion was three straight days where the average dew point exceeded 54ยบ.  Currently (2013/06/15), we've only had one such day, though the peak dew point has exceeded 54ยบ two days in a row.
